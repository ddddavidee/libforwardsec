	// We explicitly set the number of tags to 1 here for clarity, but this is the default.
	// We only need one tag for forward security. Tag's are what we puncture on.

	std::string tag = "ThisShouldBeUniquePerMessage"; 

	// Encrypt a message. Pk is the key of the intended recipient, msg is  the message 
	// the third argument is the time interval. Intervals start at 1.

	// The API supports instantiating the scheme with multiple tags. Because we constructed 
	// the instance with one tag, we can only use one. So we use {{tags}} to make 
	// a vector with one element in it

	forwardsec::bytes decrypted_msg = forwardSecureEncryption.decrypt(pk,sk,ct);

	// Now that we decrypted the message we need to remove are ability to do so
	/// to ensure forward security of that message.

	// this instance to have one tag, we only need that one tag 
	std::string msg_tag = ct.getTags().at(0);
 
	// Now we puncture. We specify the interval and the tag
	forwardSecureEncryption.puncture(pk,sk,ct.interval,msg_tag);

	// When this interval is over we can derive the next interval 
	forwardSecureEncryption.prepareNextInterval(pk,sk);
	// if at some point you need to derive some interval in the future
	// e.g. your intervals are one second long , but for 30 seconds you got no traffic,
	// then use 

	forwardSecureEncryption.deriveKeyFor(pk,sk,31);
	// note, to puncture this interval , you will then need to actually prepare it's child keys too
	// if you don't do so, you cannot decrypt. To do so, use:
	forwardSecureEncryption.prepareIntervalAfter(pk,sk,31);

	// finally at some point you should actually delete interval keys.
	// If you don't any messages that weren't delivered (perhaps because an attacker intercepted them)
	// are still exposed.

	sk.erase(1); // deletes the keys for interval one. 

	// finally. Here is how you serialize stuff. This works for pk,sk and ct.
	std::stringstream ss; // this can also be a file or any compatible stream
